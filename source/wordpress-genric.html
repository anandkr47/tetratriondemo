            WORDPRESS ELEARNING PORTAL FOR BEAUTICIANS</h1>
        <br></br>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <Br></Br>
        <p>We have created WordPress site for beauticians. This site was heavily customized with Ajax Event calendar plugin 
            to create various courses. Here user can register for their courses by completing an online payment process for 
            their respective course. The details of the successful purchase are saved in the zoho crm using the zoho crm API.

            When user opts for a virtual class, the users get details of the fuze meeting link to attend the class virtually 
            from any location of the world, which is dynamically created using the Fuze API. The user can also enjoy the recorded
             courses of a class from a LMS namely Litmos after choosing for such a course, which was created dynamically using the Litmos API.
            
            We have  also implemented a coupon functionality, using which the registering users can get discount on particular 
            course. The admin has a wide range of options to apply the coupons to one, many, selected, or all courses.
             We have also implemented a message board functionality for each course, where the admin can set custom messages
              which would be sent to the user on registering for a course.
             We have created an advanced search functionality which filters course name, type, location etc.
