        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <Br></Br>
        <p>Designed and implemented a Django based web application to allow patients to search for doctors/hospitals,
           rate and add reviews for them. The application implements radius-based search where visitors/patients can 
           enter their preferred location to determine nearby doctors/hospitals based on doctor/clinic addresses in
            the PostgreSQL DB using geo locations. The application can also detect a user’s location and pre-fill the 
            location box for user. The user can then search the doctors/hospitals based on distance specified from his 
            location, as well as select a filter on specialties and procedures which are served by doctors/hospitals.
             The application also remembers the users’ last location searched to make it easier for the user to further 
             search from where they left off on their next visit to the page. User can sort the search results based on
              procedures and their prices (categorized in insurance price and cash price), highest rated doctors,
               most rated doctors, distance from user’s location.</p>
